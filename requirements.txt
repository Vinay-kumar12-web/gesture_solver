requirements.txt is a text file that lists all the Python libraries your project needs to run. It's like a checklist so anyone who clones your project can install exactly what they need with one single command.

ðŸ“¢ Why it's important?
âœ… Helps others (and future-you) quickly install dependencies.

âœ… Required for deployment, packaging, and collaboration.

âœ… Keeps your project clean, documented, and professional.

ðŸ›  How to Create It?
ðŸ‘‰ Run this in your terminal inside the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip freeze > requirements.txt
This will auto-save all installed packages into requirements.txt.
But we can also write it manually if we want it minimal and clean.

âœ¨ Clean Version for Your Project:
Hereâ€™s a clean and simple requirements.txt for your gesture-controlled math solver:

txt
Copy
Edit
opencv-python>=4.5.0
numpy>=1.18.0
pyttsx3>=2.90
You can copy that directly into your file.

ðŸš€ How to Use It?
After cloning your GitHub repo, anyone can install all required libraries like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Boom ðŸ’¥â€” environment ready!

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips:
If you use extra stuff like mediapipe, matplotlib, etc. in the future, just add them to this file.

Keep it lightweight â€” don't dump 100 unnecessary libraries in it.

If you use a virtual environment, itâ€™s even better to freeze from that.
